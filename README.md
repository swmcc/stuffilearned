## Description

I am constantly striving to learn new things. This is a repo is simply to keep 
the stuff I've learnt. 

Each example will be a few sentences and some example code explaining the concept and 
bits of syntax, commands, or tips I've recently learned.

This repo is based on [til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) from [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/).
