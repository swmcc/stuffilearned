## Description

I am constantly striving to learn new things. This is a repo is simply to keep 
the stuff I've learnt. 

Each example will be a few sentences and some example code explaining the concept and 
bits of syntax, commands, or tips I've recently learned.

This repo is based on [til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) from [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/).

## Background

At the start of 2015 I decided to commit to [Github](http://www.github.com/swmcc/) at least once a day. 
Here is the accompaning [blog post](http://www.theonlystephen.com/blog/2015/03/24/50_Day_GitHub_Streak.html) about it. 
The rules were fairly simple:

   - Any commit counts
   - Any issue counts

My get out clause to [stop breaking the chain](http://dontbreakthechain.com/) is to add an issue or add
an alias to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles) repo. When I got to [100 days](http://www.theonlystephen.com/github-100day-commits/) I
done some stats on my contributions. Adding an issue wasn't as common as I thought it was and 90% of them were closed within a week of them being 
created so all things being equal that side of things was ok. The real killer was just adding [an](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/b67ec430842415a381d29b06bae16913c0520648) [alias](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/9bff10f9f7e4e7382c22ae5c17ae3519e55bc0b3) [to](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/3a314a76185ccdc92e17014357177a483661784d) [my](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/0727c13d65f010332ff8bcbe6f8da335b0aaf37f) [dotfiles](https://github.com/swmcc/dotfiles/commit/b39763c932234b141f5047b3da54a4165508dd29).

So instead of adding aliases to my dotfiles I've decided to create this repo and use whatever I have learnt in here. Most of it will be simple
hacks or workflow add ons. I would think. Who knows. Lets see what happens.
